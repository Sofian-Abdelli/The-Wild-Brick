# The Wild Brick

Collaborative project created as part of a web development training program.  
The site is structured around several sections: welcome, shop, creations, events, and about.

## Branches Already Created

All feature branches have been created from `dev`.  
Each branch corresponds to a specific section of the site:

- `main`: main branch, clean and validated  
- `dev`: shared development branch  
- `0001nav-bar.footer`: navigation bar and footer  
- `0002welcome`: welcome section  
- `0003shop`: shop page  
- `0004créations`: creations section  
- `0005évents`: events section  
- `0006about`: about page

## Git Workflow

Each developer works on their own feature branch based on `dev`.

### Steps to contribute:
1. Switch to `dev`  
2. Work on your dedicated branch  
3. Commit your changes  
4. Push the branch to GitHub  
5. Create a pull request to `dev`
