                <p>Chinez, energetic mom turned Lego enthusiast! What started as playtime with my eldest daughter has
                    become a full-blown passion. My apartment is now a mini Lego museum.
                    Through this website, I hope to share that passion, my favorite sets, creative projects, building
                    tips, and the joy of creating something new with just a handful of bricks.
                    Whether youâ€™re a fellow parent, a Lego fan, or simply curious, welcome to our world !

                </article>
                <p>I started playing with LEGOs when I was a child at my great-grandmotherâ€™s house, where she used to
                    look after me. I played with my cousins, creating stories and entire villages in an afternoon. This
                    passion has never left me since, as Iâ€™ve gone on to build more complex structures inspired by pop
                    culture or my imagination. For me, each creation is a challenge, a moment of escape during which the
                    world around me and any sense of time disappear.</p>

                </article>
                <p>Passionate about manga and Japanese culture, I draw inspiration from their strong values and unique
                    aesthetics. LEGO allows me to give shape to that creativity, building without limits. Finally,
                    motorcycling reflects my spirit of adventure and freedom, completing this universe that fuels my
                    curiosity and drive to create.</p>

                    to destroying her masterpieces. Much like when he strolls across the keyboard right in the middle of
                    her code.
